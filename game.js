// logic
// every time user clicks a button, all the items on board
// move to that direction

// each piece that lands on equal piece, combine based on 
// the direction of the button pressed

// every time a button is pressed, a new item spawns into a 
// random free space on the map

// game ends when a piece containing 2048 is reached
